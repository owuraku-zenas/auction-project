## AutoBid — Car Auction Platform

A modern platform to list cars for sale and run time‑boxed auctions where buyers place competitive bids. Designed for transparency, speed, and trust between sellers and buyers.

### Highlights
- **Listings**: Create, browse, search, and filter cars by make, model, year, mileage, location, and price.
- **Auctions & Bidding**: Real‑time bidding with automatic bid increments, reserve price, and anti‑sniping extension.
- **User Accounts**: Email/password auth, profiles, KYC option for high‑value sales.
- **Payments/Escrow (roadmap)**: Hold funds with a payment provider until handover is confirmed.
- **Messaging**: Seller–buyer Q&A per listing.
- **Reviews & Ratings**: Reputation for sellers and buyers.
- **Admin**: Moderate listings, handle disputes, and manage reports.

## Tech Stack
- **Backend**: Python (FastAPI or Flask recommended)
- **Database**: PostgreSQL (recommended), SQLite for local dev
- **Realtime**: WebSockets for live bids (Socket.IO or FastAPI websockets)
- **Cache/Queue**: Redis for countdowns, bid processing, and notifications
- **Frontend**: React/Next.js (optional in this repo)
- **Infra**: Docker + Docker Compose (optional), CI via GitHub Actions (optional)

Note: This repository currently contains a minimal Python entry point (`main.py`). As features are implemented, the stack sections above should be updated to reflect reality.

## Core Concepts
- **Listing**: A car posted by a seller with detailed specs, images, and disclosures.
- **Auction**: A time‑boxed event tied to a listing with start/end time, reserve price, and bid increment rules.
- **Bid**: A user’s monetary offer. Highest valid bid wins when the auction ends and reserve is met.
- **Watchlist**: Users track listings and receive notifications.

### Example Data Model (draft)
- User: id, name, email, hash_password, rating
- Listing: id, seller_id, title, description, make, model, year, mileage, location, images[], created_at, status
- Auction: id, listing_id, reserve_price, min_increment, starts_at, ends_at, extended_until
- Bid: id, auction_id, bidder_id, amount, created_at
- Review: id, reviewer_id, reviewee_id, rating, comment, created_at

## API Sketch (to be implemented)
- Auth
  - POST `/api/auth/register`
  - POST `/api/auth/login`
- Listings
  - GET `/api/listings` (search/filter)
  - POST `/api/listings`
  - GET `/api/listings/{listingId}`
  - PATCH `/api/listings/{listingId}`
- Auctions
  - GET `/api/auctions/{auctionId}`
  - POST `/api/auctions/{listingId}/start`
  - GET `/api/auctions/{auctionId}/bids`
  - POST `/api/auctions/{auctionId}/bids`
- Realtime
  - WS `/ws/auctions/{auctionId}` → subscribe to live bids and countdowns

Validation rules and error formats should follow a consistent JSON error envelope (e.g., `{ code, message, details }`).

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.10+
- (Optional) Docker & Docker Compose

### Clone
```bash
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd day2-git-and-github
```

### Run locally (minimal placeholder)
This repo currently has a simple Python script.
```bash
python main.py
```

### Suggested app structure (future)
```
backend/
  app/
    api/
    core/
    models/
    services/
    websocket/
  tests/
frontend/
  (optional)
```

## Development

### Environment variables (proposed)
- `DATABASE_URL` – e.g., `postgresql://user:pass@localhost:5432/autobid`
- `REDIS_URL` – e.g., `redis://localhost:6379/0`
- `JWT_SECRET` – secret for auth tokens
- `APP_ENV` – `development` | `production` | `test`

### Virtual environment
```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # Windows (WSL friendly): source .venv/bin/activate
python -m pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -r requirements.txt  # when added
```

### Tests (placeholder)
```bash
pytest -q
```

### Lint & Format (suggested)
- Ruff / Flake8, Black, isort
```bash
ruff check .
black .
isort .
```

## Auction Logic (high‑level)
- Bids must be ≥ current_highest + min_increment.
- If bid arrives in the last N minutes (e.g., 2m), extend auction by M minutes (anti‑sniping).
- Reserve price must be met; otherwise auction can close without a sale.
- All updates broadcast via websocket to subscribers.

---

## Security & Trust
- Store hashed passwords only (Argon2/bcrypt).
- Strict input validation and rate limiting on bidding endpoints.
- Audit log for bid edits/cancellations (ideally disallowed except clear mistakes with admin review).
- Images scanned for malware/abuse; EXIF stripping.

---

## Deployment (outline)
- Dockerize backend and run DB + Redis via Compose.
- Apply DB migrations on startup.
- Configure HTTPS, CORS, logging, and observability (OpenTelemetry).
